## Key Findings Summary

### Hardware Architecture
- **12 axes** across 2 stages (6 axes per stage)
- **Asynchronous movement** with polling-based completion detection
- **Servo management** requiring explicit enable/disable
- **Alignment system** with 30+ configuration parameters
- **ADS network communication** (IP-based controller connection)

### Reference Architecture Patterns
- **Three-layer design:** SDK → Daemon → Backend
- **Backend abstraction:** Real (DLL) + Mock (simulation)
- **Lifecycle management:** State machine with 5 states
- **FastAPI integration:** Routers with dependency injection
- **Testing strategy:** Backend abstraction enables full test coverage

### Critical Implementation Requirements
1. Async movement requires polling-based completion detection
2. Servo must be explicitly enabled before movement
3. Multi-axis coordination via Axis2D objects
4. Alignment parameters are complex (30+ fields)
5. Error codes must be mapped to exceptions
6. Backend control loop needs robust state tracking

## Notes

- The original probe-station-api repository referenced in CLAUDE.md is not available; analysis is based on suruga_sample_program.py and reachy_mini patterns
- All code examples include source file references with line numbers
- Error handling patterns focus on replacing string-based codes with proper exception hierarchy
- Testing strategy leverages backend abstraction for full coverage without hardware
